    assuming one does not already exist.

    -   Clearly describe your issue, including steps to reproduce when
        it is a bug, or some justification for a proposed improvement.

    account. Or use this line in your shell terminal:

    `git clone git@github.com:your-username/<REPO>.git`

## Making changes

    each commit indicates one concept

    guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).
-   Make sure you write [good commit
    messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

-   Run *all* the tests using `devtools::check()` to assure nothing else
    was accidentally broken.
