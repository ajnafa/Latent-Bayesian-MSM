<td style="text-align:justify;">The past two decades have been characterized by considerable progress in developing approaches to causal inference in situations where true experimental manipulation is either impractical or impossible. With few exceptions, however, commonly employed techniques in political science have developed largely within the frequentist framework [i.e., @Blackwell2018; @Imai2019; @Torres2020]. In this article, we argue that common approaches rest fundamentally upon assumptions that are difficult to defend in many areas of political research and highlight the benefits of quantifying uncertainty in the estimation of causal effects [@Gill1999; @Gill2020; @Schrodt2014; @Western1994]. Extending the approach to causal inference for cross-sectional time series and panel data under selection on observables introduced by @Blackwell2018, we develop a two-step Bayesian approach to the estimation of marginal structural models. We demonstrate our proposed procedure in the context of parametric survival analysis and Gaussian state-space models via a simulation study and two empirical examples. Finally, we provide flexible open-source software implementing the proposed method.</td>

## Bayesian Inference in Political Science

Introduced to political science in a series of articles by Bruce Western and Simon Jackman [@Western1994; @Western1998; @Jackman2000; @Jackman2004], Bayesian inference provides several advantages over the frequentist paradigm, particularly for observational research in comparative politics and international relations where the logic of classical inference is often difficult to defend in practice [@Western1994; @Gill1999; @Gill2020; @Schrodt2014]. Paired with significant advances in computational power, the development of efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms and user-friendly open-source software packages has made Bayesian inference widely accessible to researchers in the social sciences [@Buerkner2017; @Buerkner2018; @Goodrich2020]. Despite its popularity in the development of measurement models [@Claassen2019; @Claassen2020a; @Clinton2004; @Juhl2018; @Marquardt2018], the application of Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing remains relatively rare and is generally limited to circumstances where appropriate frequentist models cannot be applied such as in the presence of complete separation in discrete choice models [@Rainey2016; @Gelman2008]. Since some readers may be unfamiliar with the logic and principles of Bayesian methods, this section provides a brief overview of contemporary Bayesian inference and its advantages over the null hypothesis significance testing paradigm that remains dominant in political science.^[It is worth noting here that there is relatively little agreement among statisticians regarding the application of Bayesian estimation and the meaning of the term often varies substantially within and across disciplines. Our definition herein follows that of @Gelman2012 and @McElreath2020 that views priors as assumptions about the universe of plausible effect sizes and emphasizes aggressive model checking as opposed to the philosophical Bayesian view of priors as entirely subjective beliefs.]
