### Abstract

> The past two decades have been characterized by considerable progress
> in developing approaches to causal inference in situations where true
> experimental manipulation is either impractical or impossible. With
> few exceptions, however, commonly employed techniques in political
> science have developed largely within the frequentist framework (i.e.,
> Blackwell and Glynn 2018; Imai and Kim 2019; Torres 2020). In this
> article, we argue that common approaches rest fundamentally upon
> assumptions that are difficult to defend in many areas of political
> research and highlight the benefits of quantifying uncertainty in the
> estimation of causal effects (Gill 1999; Gill and Heuberger 2020;
> Schrodt 2014; Western and Jackman 1994). Extending the approach to
> causal inference for cross-sectional time series and panel data under
> selection on observables introduced by Blackwell and Glynn (2018), we
> develop a two-step Bayesian approach to the estimation of marginal
> structural models. We demonstrate our proposed procedure in the
> context of parametric survival analysis and Gaussian state-space
> models via a simulation study and two empirical examples. Finally, we
> provide flexible open-source software implementing the proposed
> method.
